        <p>Hi everyone,
            My name is Juan Pablo Espinoza and I am from Chile. I was born there and raised in different cities until I finished School. 
            I met my wife on the Internet… I’m sure you have read her post already, her name is Sara Rivadeneira, and she is also in this class! We got married and sealed in the temple of Guayaquil, Ecuador... We have our daughter Sarah 19, and our dog ‘Hanna’ 8 years old, and recently, we’ve adopted a cat, her name is Lucy-Fernanda (haha).  
            My wife and I served as Pathway Missionaries some years ago and now our daughter is enrolled too.  
            What I like about BYU is that I can learn without pressure, and I can meet people from different places with totally different backgrounds...
